Introduction
============

YamFlow proposes a reference workflow for machine learning (ML).
This reference workflow is aimed to provide a canonical taxonomy for 
practitioners to understand and communicate the activity and data flows
typically involved in a ML process. In addition, YamFlow also serves
as the baseline for `YAM.AI <https://www.yam.ai>`_ to architect a 
programming framework for coding interoperable and composable ML tasks.
